## Overview

This repository contains all the resources, notes, experiments, and projects I have worked on as I learn machine learning. I have included details of the various algorithms, frameworks, and libraries I’ve explored, as well as the practical applications I have implemented. 

### Learning Path:
- **Introduction to Machine Learning**
- **Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)**
- **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)**
- **Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs)**
- **Model Evaluation and Tuning**
- **Projects and Hands-on Work**

## Learning Process

My learning journey is based on a combination of online courses, books, research papers, and hands-on experimentation. Some of the resources I’ve used include:

- Coursera: [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
- Books: 
  - "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron
  - "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville
- YouTube Tutorials and Lectures
- Kaggle competitions for real-world problem-solving

This repository is an ongoing project, and I will continuously add new work and insights as I progress.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to work on the following areas:

- **Deep Learning Models**: Dive deeper into CNNs, RNNs, and GANs.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learn about Q-learning and advanced RL algorithms.
- **Advanced Projects**: Implement projects like sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, and object detection.
- **Machine Learning in Production**: Learn about deploying models and handling real-world challenges in ML.
